# FlpInfoer
A Python 3.10-based tool using [PyFlp](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP) v2.2.1 to parse FL Studio project files (.flp).

### Current Features

2. Export patterns by track ‚ùå  
3. Export full-song .mid with tracks ‚ùå  

### Format & Positioning
**Note format:** `[start_bar:step:tick - end_bar:step:tick, pitch, instrument] (duration=ticks)`  
**Positioning:** Bar (1-based) : Step (00-15, hex) : Tick (00-23, 24ppq)
